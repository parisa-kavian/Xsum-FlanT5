We ought not to have a situation in which we set up an inquiry and then we can only do half the job because police inquiries are ongoing.\\\"\\nMr Evans, who was a Wales Office minister in the 1990s when the UK government set up the Waterhouse inquiry into abuse allegations at children's homes in north Wales, added: \\\"It seems to me that the police inquiries are now at the forefront.\\\"\\nHe said Mrs May should not be blamed for delays to the inquiry, which has been held up by the resignation of her first two choices of chairperson.\\nVictims must have confidence in the process, Mr Evans said, \\\"and so the reason we are in the situation we are in is that we are struggling to find a chairman that the victims' groups will have confidence in\\\".\",\n          \"One head teacher decided \\\"all reading can be done on iPads,\\\" a delegate told the Association of Teachers and Lecturers' annual conference.\\nThe union voted to lobby for libraries to be included in Ofsted inspections.\\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said that school libraries \\\"played a vital role\\\".\\nCathy Tattersfield from Derbyshire quoted international evidence suggesting a positive correlation between good school libraries and student attainment.\\nMs Tattersfield said she had been \\\"shocked\\\" that two secondary academies had \\\"recently closed or attempted to close their libraries and several of them have had their librarian hours or posts cut, mostly in the ex-mining areas of Derbyshire\\\".\\nA survey of 485 ATL members last month suggested a patchy picture on library provision said Ms Tattersfield.\\n\\\"It seems to be feast or famine.\\n\\\"Some secondary provision is fine, cherished and secured,\\\" - but others faced reduced opening hours, conversion to e-learning centres, cuts in staff hours, or librarians having been removed or replaced by support staff or teachers.\\n\\\"We identified a third of secondary schools have had cuts of 40% or more since 2010, with 20% redundancies in library staff at their school.\\\"\\nAnother delegate said his school library, closed last year, had provided a host of benefits to pupils, from paired reading for special needs pupils to introducing able readers to new authors and running a range of enrichment activities.\\nHe said the library's books and magazines had been distributed among subject departments.\\n\\\"Lesley Mumbray-Williams whose school dispensed with her services as librarian said a third of the stock had ended up in skips within three weeks of her leaving.\\\"\\nAnother delegate said the librarian post in their school had not been filled and the library doors were often locked.\\nOf the education staff who responded to the survey:\\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \\\"We want all children to read widely and well and believe school libraries can play a vital role in fostering that love of reading.\\n\\\"We trust schools to decide on whether to provide and maintain a library service for their pupils.\\\"\",\n          \"The mix-up led to the body of Philip Bradburn being cremated instead of that of Conservative MEP Philip Bradbourn.\\nA failure to provide written records created confusion between the two similar sounding surnames, the Heart of England NHS Trust said.\\nThe trust and Central England Co-operative apologised for the blunder.\\nFormer MEP Mr Bradbourn died at Good Hope Hospital, Sutton Coldfield on 20 December.\\nMr Bradburn died at University Hospital Birmingham four days later and his body was sent to a funeral directors run by Central England Co-operative.\\nAs Good Hope's mortuary was nearing capacity, a request was made by hospital staff to move four bodies - including Mr Bradbourn's - to the funeral company.\\nThe names of those to be moved were given over the phone but not followed up with an email listing their names and addresses, the report found.\\nUpdates on this story and more from Birmingham and the Black Country\\nThe undertaker collected Mr Bradbourn's body, but four days later returned it to Good Hope, when his family requested to change his burial to a cremation.\\nMeanwhile, Mr Bradburn's body was sent back to the hospital over concerns it had been at the funeral directors for some time.\\nWhen it arrived at Good Hope from the funeral directors, paperwork carrying his surname was overwritten with the surname of the politician.\\nDoctors looked at these papers and signed off the cremation for Mr Bradbourn but the body of Mr Bradburn was released.\\nCentral England Co-operative said: \\\"Our priority has been to work closely with all concerned so that we can learn from this unfortunate incident and build further appropriate safeguards for the future.\\\"\\nDr Andrew Catto, of Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust said there had been a \\\"rare and complex set of circumstances\\\".\\nHe said: \\\"We are very sorry that this incredibly distressing situation has happened.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11323,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Two schoolboys aged 12 and 13 have been arrested after concerns were raised about children sharing inappropriate images on social media.\",\n          \"Multi-storey car parks, bridges and tall buildings could be designed to make suicide more difficult, under government proposals to save lives.\",\n          \"Plans set out by the Sussex police and crime commissioner (PCC) to take responsibility for fire services in East and West Sussex -
